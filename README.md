First you gonna have to install python into your computer if you dont have 
# Go the python official website, download the recent python version. 

Once you download it, it should create a folder called "python 3.10," which is the most recent version.
Open the folder and choose the "install certificate command."

Following that, all of the prerequisites you require will be downloaded to your computer.
Next, at the terminal, navigate to the proper folder and run "pip3 install discord.py."


When you've completed those steps, you'll want to open vsc code and the discord bot file.
To execute the bot, open a terminal and type "python3 bot.py" into it.








This is for my second year SE Thematic Project unit, my team is making a discord bot.
